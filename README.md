🎮 Rock Paper Scissors (Learning Project)  This project is my practice while learning Java Swing and JFrame. I wanted to understand how GUI applications work in Java, so I built a simple Rock–Paper–Scissors game.


📝 What I Learned

How to create a window using JFrame.

Adding interactive components like buttons (JButton) for Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

Showing results on the screen with labels (JLabel).

Handling button clicks using ActionListener.

Organizing a basic GUI layout in Swing.

🎯 Game Flow

The user clicks on one of the buttons: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

The computer makes a random choice.

The result (Win/Lose/Draw) is displayed on the screen.

🚀 Why I Built This

I’m learning Swing step by step, and this project helped me understand how JFrame, JButton, and JLabel come together to make a small interactive application.
